## Feed Reader Testing ##
The project title is feed reader testing App, It is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. `Jasmine 2.1.2` was used for testing. In programming, `testing` is important in oreder to check all the functionalities of your program/code. This project helped me to boost my skills in writing test code.

## How to run the App ##
The App can be locally by following this steps:
- Ensure that you have the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in the system
- Clone/download the code and unzip on your machine
- run the index.thml file to view what the app is doing.

## The Test Suites ##
The test suite for the feed reader testing is basically, four:
1. The RSS test suite:
* It is the first test suite that tests to ensure that `allFeeds` variables has been defined and that it is not empty. 
* To test if it works properly, change `allFeeds` in `apps.js` to be empty array and refesh the page to see what happens.
* also checks if URL is defined and if the Name property is not empty

2. The Menu Test suite
* The second test suite that ensures that all menu element is hidden by default.
